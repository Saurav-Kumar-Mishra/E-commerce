## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Saurav-Kumar-Mishra/E-commerce.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd E-commerce
  

4. Install the dependencies:

   npm install
   

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Environment Variables

To run the application, you need to set up environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:


REACT_APP_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
REACT_APP_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
REACT_APP_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id


Replace `your_public_key`, `your_service_id`, and `your_template_id` with your actual EmailJS keys.
