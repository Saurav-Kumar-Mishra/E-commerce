                Founded in 2024 by Saurav Kumar Mishra, OneStopShop has come a
                long way from its beginnings in a home office. When Saurav Kumar
                Mishra first started out, his passion for providing high-quality
                and innovative products drove him to do extensive research, quit
                his day job, and turn hard work and inspiration into a booming
                online store. We now serve customers all over India and are
                thrilled to be a part of the fair trade wing of the E-commerce
                industry.
